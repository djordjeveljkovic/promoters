## Recently shipped (since last audit — 2026-06-22)
- [x] **B-001 Admin can create orders** ✅ — `AdminOrderController::create/store` implemented; admin order form posts to `admin.orders.store`.
- [x] **B-002 Admin order detail has rerun/email/print buttons** ✅ — added the same buttons the promoter show page has, plus a stats card.
- [x] **B-003 Festival colour NOT NULL fallback** ✅ — `normaliseColor(null)` no longer forces a NULL into the column.
- [x] **B-005 `downloadQRCodes` checks festival scope** ✅ — added the defensive check.
- [x] **B-006 Order create route pluralised** ✅ — `/orders/create` redirects to `/order/create`.
- [x] **Implicit binding for `{festival}`** ✅ — `Route::bind('festival')` resolves by id or slug; `Festival::__toString` returns the slug so route() helpers never break.
- [x] **Listener auto-queue serialization fix** ✅ — `NotifyUserOfFailedImageGeneration` is now synchronous (was ShouldQueue) to fix the chain-dispatch "Serialization of Closure" error.
- [x] **Bus::chain wrapped in try/catch in both order controllers** ✅ — a job-dispatch failure no longer rolls back a successful order.
- [x] **Serbian pagination + passwords translations** ✅ — `lang/sr/pagination.php`, `lang/sr/passwords.php`.
- [x] **Dead code moved to `_deprecated/`** ✅ — `OrderController1.php` → `docs/_deprecated/`; `SetLocaleMiddleware.php` → `app/Http/Middleware/_deprecated/`.
- [x] **Regression tests** ✅ — `tests/Feature/AdminOrderCreateTest.php`, `tests/Feature/FestivalColorFallbackTest.php`.

## Recently shipped (2026-06-22 — third audit)
- [x] **M-007 `CommissionCalculator` service** ✅ — extracted the tier-overlap math from `User::calculateCommission()` into `App\Services\CommissionCalculator` + `NoCommissionTierException`. The old static method is now a back-compat shim. New edge cases handled (open-ended `max_sold=0`, history-aware counting, no-tier case throws instead of silently returning 0). Covered by 13-case unit test.
- [x] **T-005 Calculator unit tests** ✅ — `tests/Unit/CommissionCalculatorTest.php`.
- [x] **M-006 Admin dashboard caching** ✅ — extracted heavy computation to `computeDashboardStats()`, wrapped in `Cache::remember(…, 60, …)` keyed by (user, role, festival). `TicketOrder::booted()` busts the cache on every save/delete. Covered by `AdminDashboardCachingTest`.
- [x] **T-003 End-to-end order flow test** ✅ — `tests/Feature/EndToEndOrderFlowTest.php` covers the full POST → chain dispatch → commission calculation path with `Bus::fake()`.
- [x] **M-010 Welcome page hero driven by config + DB** ✅ — the page derives the festival name + year from the active public festival at runtime.
- [x] **M-012 Open Graph / SEO meta tags** ✅ — `partials.head` now accepts `$description`, `$ogImage`, `$ogType`; the layouts forward them; the public promoter page wires up bio + avatar.
- [x] **P-001 Sub-promoter dashboard banner** ✅ — explicitly names the parent promoter.
- [x] **P-006 Two more dashboard quick-action tiles** ✅ — Leaderboard + Mail templates added to the admin dashboard grid.
- [x] **P-007 Locale-aware date formatting** ✅ — `App\Support\Format` helper with full `FormatTest` coverage; replaced hand-rolled `->format('Y-m-d')` in the order/promoter dashboards.
- [x] **`TicketCommission` model $fillable fix** ✅ — `valid_from` and `valid_to` are now mass-assignable; without this the tier-overlap math silently used `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP` for every seeded tier. Discovered by `CommissionCalculatorTest`.
- [x] **`TicketOrder::total_commission_earned` $fillable fix** ✅ — the field was missing from `$fillable`, so any mass-assignment via `update(['total_commission_earned' => …])` was a silent no-op. Discovered by `EndToEndOrderFlowTest`.
- [x] **Locale-aware money formatter** ✅ — `Format::money(12500)` → `"12,500.00 RSD"`.

Test count after third audit: **160 passed / 383 assertions** (up from 135 / 339).

## Recently shipped (2026-06-22 — second audit)
- [x] **U-004 Mail template editor surfaces promoter / admin templates** ✅ — added `promoter.new_order`, `admin.daily_summary`, `admin.image_generation_failed` keys.
- [x] **U-005 Promoter avatar upload** ✅ — added file upload to the admin promoter-edit form, controller moves the file to `public/img/promoter_avatars/`.
- [x] **U-007 "Resend last 5" on promoter dashboard** ✅ — added the action button next to "New order".
- [x] **M-005 N+1 in `AdminController::promoters()`** ✅ — replaced per-promoter loops with a single grouped aggregate.
- [x] **M-011 Explicit route binding for `{festival}`** ✅ — slugs resolve everywhere.
- [x] **B-011 Festival `__toString` returns slug** ✅ — route generators that interpolate the model get a stable URL.
- [x] **M-001 Serbian pagination + passwords** ✅ — already done in first pass.

## Previously shipped (since last audit)

- [x] **P-072 Language switcher** ✅ — Livewire component in sidebar + auth pages, session-persisted, `SetLocale` middleware honors `?lang=` / `Accept-Language`.
- [x] **P-069 Global search** ✅ — Livewire component (debounced 250 ms) over festivals/promoters/orders/ticket-types, scoped to accessible festivals, top-bar wired on every page.
- [x] **P-070 Promoter public profile** ✅ — `/p/{id}` route + view, `is_public` toggle + bio field on `users`, 404 for private profiles and non-promoter users.
- [x] **P-027 Promoter commission statement** ✅ — `/admin/festivals/{festival}/promoter/{id}/statement` page with summary stats, per-ticket-type breakdown, order-by-order ledger, and print-friendly CSS for Ctrl+P → PDF.

## Sprint 5 — Polish (P-100+)
- Deferred.

## Bonus fixes (during the sprint)
- Bumped all ticket-type controller signatures to accept the `{festival}` route param
  first, matching Laravel 12's parameter-order quirk (the same fix went into
  `OrderController@show` and the `TicketController` CRUD).
- Moved the dead `OrderController1.php` to a non-autoloaded `_deprecated`
  namespace so it can't cause a "Cannot declare class" error if anyone ever
  autoloads it.
- Added `festival_id` to the `Ticket` model `$fillable` (was missing —
  the scanner couldn't persist `scanned_at`).
- Added the `tickets.scanned_at` column via a new migration.
